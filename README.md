<h1 align="center">Portal 2 RTX Remix Compatibility Mod</h1>

<div align="center" markdown="1"> 

This client modification is specifically made for nvidia's [rtx-remix](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/rtx-remix).  
How does a shader based game work with remix? By manually reimplementing fixed function rendering :) 

<br>

__WIP__ & __Please Note:__  
RTX Remix was never intented to support Portal 2.  
If you encounter crashes, broken things or similar, it's either due to incompatibility, the limits of fixed function rendering (not being able to get the same result that shaders can achieve)  
or due to bugs in the compatibility mod itself.  

<br>

### This is not trying to be a remaster.
It simply makes the game compatible with RTX Remix.

Please keep that in mind.

### __[ Remix Compatibility Features ]__   
🔹Most things are rendered using the fixed-function pipeline🔹  
🔹Remix friendly culling and the ability to manually override culling🔹  
🔹Per map loading of remix config files to set remix variables🔹  
🔹Ability to animate remix variables on events🔹  
🔹Spawning of unique anchor meshes🔹  
🔹Per map fog settings🔹

## Usage / Installation
> [!CAUTION]
> Breaking Change __IF you used earlier versions__ of the Compatibility Mod:
> - Go to `Path-to-Portal2/bin` and remove `winmm.dll` + `_rtx.asi` before proceeding

----

- Download the latest [release](https://github.com/xoxor4d/p2-rtx/releases) and follow instructions found there.
> - The `.zip` with the commit hash contains the files to make the game compatibile with RTX Remix  
> - The `_remix_mod.zip` contains a base remix-mod required to get portals to work (and a few emissive textures etc.)
- To avoid rebuilding the sound cache on first startup, copy `_master.cache` from  
`root/portal2/maps/soundcache` to `root/portal2_dlc3/maps/soundcache`
- Your folder structure should look like [this](#folder-structure)
- Start the game by executing `p2-rtx-launcher.exe`
- The window title should change to `Portal 2 - RTX` followed by the GitHub commit number if successful

- [Set graphic options](#graphic-settings) ⚠️ 
> - Shader Detail: Low  
> - Effect Detail: Low  
> - Model /Texture Detail: High  
> - Paged Pool Memory: High

#### ✳️ Info: 
- See the [Wiki](https://github.com/xoxor4d/p2-rtx/wiki/Compatibility-Mod-Feature-Guide) for in-depth guides on features that come with the compatibility mod 🍓
  
- Current releases ship with a [custom build of the remix-dxvk runtime](https://github.com/xoxor4d/dxvk-remix/tree/combine/pairs_mask_rs) which includes necessary changes  
for Portal 2 (`bin/.trex/d3d9.dll`)

- Some engine tweaks that are required to make the game compatible result in CPU bottlenecks on some maps (software skinning instead of HW skinning). This may or may not improve in future updates.

#### ⚠️ Troubleshooting (click to expand):

<details><summary>Launcher not working? - Try a different way of loading</summary>

1. Download [Ultimate-ASI-Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases) (32 bit), rename `dinput8.dll` to `winmm.dll` and place it into  
   the bin folder (`Path-To-Portal2/bin/winmm.dll`)
   
2.  Rename `p2-rtx.dll` to `p2-rtx.asi` and place it into the bin folder mentioned above

3.   Right click Portal 2 on Steam and open settings - add the following start-up options:  
     -novid -disable_d3d9_hacks -limitvsconst -disallowhwmorph -softparticlesdefaultoff -no_compressed_verts +mat_phong 1`
     
4.  Sart the game from Steam

<br></details>


<details><summary>Game is too dark, sunlight is leaking on certain maps, textures look flat</summary>
<br>

- This is not an issue with the compatibility mod itself. It's up to the people modding the game using the remix toolset to place proper lights and overhaul textures and meshes.
